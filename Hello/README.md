# Hello World

# Requirements

*  Create a Web API that returns “Hello World” asynchronously. 
*  Use autofac for interface injection  between the api and a business logic service layer.
*  Consume the API from a webpage using jQuery.
*  The result should show “hello world” 10x.

# Notes

Built on .NET Core 1.1, because I don't have a recent version of Visual Studio. Got to learn how to use VS Code and the .NET CLI. Fun Times.

I think I spent more time learning how to hook up Autofac to .NET Core MVC than I did actually building the code.
